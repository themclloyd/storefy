# Security Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the security fixes applied to address vulnerabilities identified in the static code review.

## 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Hardening

### Changes Made:
- **Removed `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`** from CSP headers in both `public/_headers` and `netlify.toml`
- **Added additional CSP directives**:
  - `object-src 'none'` - Prevents plugin execution
  - `base-uri 'self'` - Restricts base URL changes
  - `form-action 'self'` - Restricts form submissions

### Files Modified:
- `public/_headers`
- `netlify.toml`

### Security Impact:
- Prevents inline script execution
- Blocks eval-based code injection
- Reduces XSS attack surface

## 2. Insecure DOM Manipulation Fixes

### Changes Made:
- **Replaced `window.open()` with `document.write()`** in printing functionality
- **Implemented secure printing approach** using temporary stylesheets and `window.print()`
- **Removed direct DOM manipulation** that could lead to XSS vulnerabilities

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/pos/ReceiptDialog.tsx`
- `src/components/transactions/TransactionReceiptDialog.tsx`

### Security Impact:
- Eliminates potential XSS vectors from dynamic content injection
- Removes dependency on popup windows that could be blocked or manipulated

## 3. Navigation Security Improvements

### Changes Made:
- **Replaced `window.location.href` assignments** with React Router navigation
- **Implemented History API** for programmatic navigation in utility functions
- **Added proper navigation context** using `useNavigate` hook

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/layout/UserMenu.tsx`
- `src/lib/authUtils.ts`

### Security Impact:
- Prevents potential open redirect vulnerabilities
- Ensures navigation stays within application context
- Maintains proper routing state management

## 4. Build Security Configuration

### Changes Made:
- **Configured source maps** for production builds (`hidden` mode)
- **Added Terser minification** with security-focused options
- **Enabled console/debugger removal** in production builds
- **Implemented code splitting** for better security boundaries

### Files Modified:
- `vite.config.ts`

### Security Impact:
- Prevents source code exposure in production
- Removes debugging information from production builds
- Improves code obfuscation

## 5. ESLint Security Rules

### Changes Made:
- **Added comprehensive security-focused ESLint rules**:
  - `no-eval`, `no-implied-eval`, `no-new-func` - Prevent code injection
  - `no-script-url` - Prevent javascript: URLs
  - `no-caller`, `no-with` - Prevent dangerous language features
  - Additional rules for secure coding practices

### Files Modified:
- `eslint.config.js`

### Security Impact:
- Prevents dangerous JavaScript patterns at development time
- Enforces secure coding practices
- Catches potential vulnerabilities during linting

## 6. Existing Security Measures Maintained

### Already Implemented:
- **DOMPurify integration** for XSS prevention (`src/lib/security.ts`)
- **Input validation and sanitization** utilities
- **Rate limiting** client-side implementation
- **Secure session management** with proper token handling
- **CSRF protection** through secure headers

## Testing Recommendations

1. **CSP Validation**: Test application functionality with strict CSP headers
2. **Navigation Testing**: Verify all navigation flows work correctly with new routing
3. **Print Functionality**: Test receipt printing across different browsers
4. **Build Verification**: Ensure production builds don't expose source maps
5. **Linting**: Run ESLint to catch any new security issues

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic security reviews
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep security-related dependencies updated
3. **CSP Monitoring**: Monitor CSP violations in production
4. **Error Tracking**: Monitor for navigation-related errors

## Additional Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**: Review and secure sensitive environment variables
2. **API Security**: Implement proper API authentication and rate limiting
3. **Data Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are validated server-side
4. **Audit Logging**: Implement comprehensive audit logging for security events

## Compliance Notes

These fixes align with:
- OWASP Top 10 security recommendations
- Content Security Policy Level 3 specifications
- Modern web security best practices
- React security guidelines
