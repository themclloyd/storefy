## 📋 Final Production Checklist

### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Apply the critical security migration: `supabase/migrations/20250728000001-critical-security-fix.sql`
- [ ] Verify environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Run `npm run build:production` to ensure clean build
- [ ] Test authentication flows in staging environment
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are working correctly
- [ ] Test PIN session functionality
- [ ] Confirm all routes are properly protected

### Post-Deployment:
- [ ] Monitor application logs for errors
- [ ] Verify security headers are applied
- [ ] Test user registration and login flows
- [ ] Confirm store creation and management works
- [ ] Test POS functionality with PIN sessions
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry recommended)

## 🛡️ Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Apply Security Migration**: Run the critical security fix migration immediately
2. **Update PIN Sessions**: Inform users that PIN sessions will need to be re-established
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any authentication or authorization errors
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all user flows work correctly with new security

### Ongoing Security:
1. **Regular Audits**: Monthly security reviews
2. **Dependency Updates**: Weekly dependency checks
3. **Log Monitoring**: Daily log review for suspicious activity
4. **User Training**: Educate users on security best practices

## 📈 Performance Monitoring
